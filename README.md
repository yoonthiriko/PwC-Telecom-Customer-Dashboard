# Telecom Customer Service Dashboard

## Description
The **Telecom Customer Service Dashboard** is a Power BI project developed to analyze and visualize key performance metrics related to customer service for a large telecom client. This project was completed as part of the **PwC Switzerland Power BI Job Simulation on Forage**, focusing on the clientâ€™s need to understand customer satisfaction and agent performance. The dashboard was created by independently replicating the provided solution design to learn from best practices in visualization and design.
